## dstore
A slightly opinionated distributed key/value store library built on top of [`spindle`](https://github.com/flowerinthenight/spindle) for Kubernetes deployments. It provides a consistent, append-only, [Spanner](https://cloud.google.com/spanner)-backed key/value storage for all pods in a deployment group.
